    <h1>About ISRO</h1>
    <p>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the space agency of India. The organisation is involved in science, engineering and technology to harvest the benefits of outer space for India and the mankind. ISRO is a major constituent of the Department of Space (DOS), Government of India. The department executes the Indian Space Programme primarily through various Centres or units within ISRO.</p>

        <p>ISRO was previously the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), set up by the Government of India in 1962, as envisioned by Dr. VikramA Sarabhai. ISRO was formed on August 15, 1969 and superseded INCOSPAR with an expanded role to harness space technology. DOS was set up and ISRO was brought under DOS in 1972.</p>
        
        <p>The prime objective of ISRO/DOS is the development and application of space technology for various national needs. To fulfil this objective, ISRO has established major space systemsfor communication, television broadcasting and meteorological services; resources monitoring and management; space-based navigation services. ISRO has developed satellite launch vehicles, PSLV and GSLV, to place the satellites in the required orbits.</p>
        
        <p>Alongside its technological advancement, ISRO contributes to science and science education in the country. Various dedicated research centres and autonomous institutions for remote sensing, astronomy and astrophysics, atmospheric sciences and space sciences in general function under the aegis of Department of Space. ISRO's own Lunar and interplanetary missions along with other scientific projects encourage and promote science education, apart from providing valuable data to the scientific community which in turn enriches science.</p>
        
        <p>ISRO has its headquarters in Bengaluru. Its activities are spread across various centres and units. Launch Vehicles are built at VikramSarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvananthapuram; Satellites are designed and developed at U R Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), Bengalure; Integration and launching of satellites and launch vehicles are carried out from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota; Development of liquid stages including cryogenic stage is carried out at Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Valiamala& Bengaluru; Sensors for Communication and Remote Sensing satellites and application aspects of the space technology are taken up at Space Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad and Remote Sensing satellite data reception processing and dissemination is entrusted to National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad.</p>
        
        <p>The activities of ISRO are guided by its Chairman, who would also be the secretary of DOS and Chairman of Space commission – the apex body that formulates the and overseas the implementation of the Indian Space Programme.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color: #424c67; border-radius: 3px;"> Chandryaan 2</h3>
                <p> Chandrayaan-3, India’s third lunar mission, achieved a historic milestone by successfully landing on the Moon’s south pole on August 23, 2023. With this, India became the first country to reach this unexplored region and the fourth to achieve a soft lunar landing after the US, Russia, and China. The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover conducted in-situ experiments, studying lunar soil, temperature, and seismic activity. Key findings include the presence of sulfur and other elements, which could support future lunar exploration. The success of Chandrayaan-3 demonstrated ISRO’s expertise in cost-effective and reliable space technology, reinforcing India’s position in global space exploration. </p>

            <h2 style="background-color: #424c67; border-radius: 3px;"> Aditya L1</h2>
                <p> Launched on September 2, 2023, Aditya-L1 is India's first space-based solar observatory, positioned at the Lagrange Point 1 (L1), about 1.5 million km from Earth. This mission aims to study the Sun’s corona, solar winds, and magnetic storms, providing insights into space weather and its impact on Earth. Equipped with seven advanced payloads, Aditya-L1 continuously monitors the Sun without Earth’s interference. Its data is crucial for predicting solar flares and geomagnetic storms, protecting satellites and power grids. The mission enhances India’s capabilities in heliophysics and deep space exploration. </p>

            <h2 style="background-color: #424c67; border-radius: 3px;"s> Gaganyaan</h2>
                <p> India’s first human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan, aims to send a three-member crew to low Earth orbit (LEO) for three days and safely return them. Expected in 2025, it involves rigorous crew training, safety tests, and launch vehicle advancements. The Test Vehicle Abort Mission (TV-D1) was successfully conducted in 2023, ensuring astronaut safety in case of emergencies. Gaganyaan will establish India as the fourth nation to send humans into space, boosting technological advancements in life-support systems, crew modules, and re-entry capabilities, and paving the way for future deep-space missions.</p>
